# University Bootstrap Landing Page

A production-ready, responsive marketing landing page built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 4, designed to simulate a real-world delivery scenario under time constraints.

This project was created as part of a front-end application test, with a strong focus on layout structure, responsiveness, usability, and clean UI implementation, rather than complex business logic.
